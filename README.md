# Final Website Plan: Small Business

## Organisation Overview:
### Organisation brief:

Client Name: Ruben Moodley
Organisation name: Auto Boutique
Service Business: Car Detailing

### The History of Auto Boutiques:

The organisation was established in 2002 (Ruben Moodley, 2023). This organisation has a link to Autoglym, which is an organisation established in Britan in 1965. Autoglym does car detailing and, manufactures car care items. Auto Boutique has over 50 employees working in the organisation currently, 10 000 hours worked and 2000 projects being done over the past 20 years. The company is in Durban Mhlanga. (Ruben Moodley, 2018)

Mission:
The mission I am tasked with is to develop a website that is easy to navigate and informative. 

Vision statement:
The current website looks stuffy. The header is under the contact information and socials of the company making it seem more like a poster and not a professional detailing company. 

Target audience: 
Car owners who want to get their car professionally cleaned. 

### Goals and Objectives:

Goal:
To bring in more clients to the physical location of the organisation by increasing traffic on online platforms and the website. 

Objective:
Increasing the number of subscribers and followers on social media will bring traffic into the website. Having a nice website will increase the likelihood of getting customers.

Current website analysis: 
The website looks unprofessional. Most problems about the website are only unnoticeable when it is viewed on a computer.  The colours used feel overwhelming making me as the user want to click off the website. 

### Design and user experience:
